Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The user plays against the computer, and the game continues until the user decides to stop.

How to Play

The user is prompted to enter a choice:

Type 0 for Rock
Type 1 for Paper
Type 2 for Scissors
The computer randomly selects a choice.

The game compares the user's choice with the computer's choice and determines the winner:

Rock (0) beats Scissors (2)
Paper (1) beats Rock (0)
Scissors (2) beats Paper (1)
If both choices are the same, it's a draw.
The user is asked if they want to play again. If they type yes, the game restarts. Otherwise, the game ends.

Requirements

Python 3.x
random module (standard with Python 3.x)
